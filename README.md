Movie Mayhem is an interactive database containing information about your most beloved films. The captivating large-panel tile display allows users to easily browse through HD posters of their favorite movies. Hovering over any tile brings up a scrolling information panel that displays pertinent information including the title, year, rating, synopsis, and starring actors. Each movie panel also provides links to download an HD wallpaper, or watch an HD trailer in a pop-up modal window. 

Movie Mayhem was created using Python, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and bootstrap.
